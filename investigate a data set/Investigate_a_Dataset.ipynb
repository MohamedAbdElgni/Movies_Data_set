    "### Dataset Description \n",
    "\n",
    "> This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.\n",
    "Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.\n",
    "There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is.\n",
    "The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question(s) for Analysis\n",
    ">**Tip**: Clearly state one or more questions that you plan on exploring over the course of the report. You will address these questions in the **data analysis** and **conclusion** sections. Try to build your report around the analysis of at least one dependent variable and three independent variables. If you're not sure what questions to ask, then make sure you familiarize yourself with the dataset, its variables and the dataset context for ideas of what to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**: Once you start coding, use NumPy arrays, Pandas Series, and DataFrames where appropriate rather than Python lists and dictionaries. Also, **use good coding practices**, such as, define and use functions to avoid repetitive code. Use appropriate comments within the code cells, explanation in the mark-down cells, and meaningful variable names. "

One option that you can take with this project is to do a lot of explorations in an initial notebook. These don't have to be organized, but make sure you use enough comments to understand the purpose of each code cell. Then, after you're done with your analysis, create a duplicate notebook where you will trim the excess and organize your steps so that you have a flowing, cohesive report."

This can be an exploratory relationship between three variables of interest, or looking at how two independent variables relate to a single dependent variable of interest. Lastly, you  should perform both single-variable (1d) and multiple-variable (2d) explorations.\n",
